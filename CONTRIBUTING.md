# Contributing to openclaw-graphiti-plugin

Thanks for your interest in contributing! 🎉

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20
- **A running Graphiti server** — optional for tests since they use a mock HTTP server

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RobertoGongora/openclaw-graphiti-plugin.git
cd openclaw-graphiti-plugin
npm install
npm test
```

## Making Changes

1. **Fork** the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Write your code — follow existing patterns and use **TypeScript**.
3. Add or update tests as needed.
4. Make sure all tests pass: `npm test`.
5. Open a **Pull Request** against `main`.

## Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase.
- TypeScript throughout — no `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Use the project's existing Vitest setup for tests.

## Reporting Issues

Issues are welcome! Whether it's a bug, a feature request, or a question — open an issue and we'll take a look.

## Questions?

If something isn't clear, open an issue and ask. We'd rather help than have you stuck.
